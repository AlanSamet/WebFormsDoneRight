# WebFormsDoneRight
WebForms is oftentimes done in backwards and convoluted ways where developers have programmed themselves into a corner. This example shows how I used to build WebForms projects, sans how I did complex templating using the BuildManager class. I'm often asked to migrate WebForms solutions to other technologies, and, as an intermediate step, I will convert the application to follow this pattern first, allowing me to convert portions of large WebForms applications to other technologies incrementally. The approach allows for business logic and models to be separated and tested while still in WebForms so that the complexity and level of effort doesn't become unmanageable as a full rewrite. I hope this helps.
